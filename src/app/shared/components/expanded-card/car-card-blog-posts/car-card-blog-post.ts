    `This is not a Peugeot 106 Quiksilver.
    Or at least, not anymore.

    It used to be, right up until October 2024, when the engine gave up somewhere between Ioannina and Athens and left me questioning both my life choices and my bank account.
    But before I explain why I decided to revive this dead little hatchback instead of walking away, let me share a small piece of old-shitbox wisdom:

    Nobody loves old cars by accident.
    You love them because you had to.

    Behind every aging car that’s still somehow surviving today, there’s a lifestyle that doesn’t revolve around stats. It’s not about numbers on paper. It’s about something far less rational and far more personal.
    And if you get it, you get it.

    The Pug is a menace.
    Not just on the road, but to my mental health and my wallet. Every other day something needs attention. A noise. A leak. A warning sign. A mystery.
    And yet, on the rare days when everything works as it should, I can’t stop smiling when I drive it.
    That’s the trap.

    I’m not a mechanic. I wouldn’t even claim I know my way around cars 70%.
    But this car forced me to learn.
    I learned how an engine actually works, not in theory, but in consequence.
    I learned how suspension setup changes the character of a car, and which setup suits my driving style.
    I learned what polyurethane bushes are, why they matter, and how much “feel” you’re willing to trade for comfort.
    I learned what a shorter shifter throw does and how a tall gear lever somehow makes everything feel more deliberate and mechanical.

    And maybe most importantly, I learned how not to lose my mind when things go wrong.

    You stop fighting it.
    You go with the flow.
    You fix what breaks.
    You drive it anyway.

    When the engine blew up, that could have been the end.
    For most people, it would've been.
    But once you’ve invested time, frustration, scraped knuckles, late nights, and small victories into a car like this, scrapping it feels like betrayal.
    So instead of walking away, I rebuilt.

    Not because it made financial sense.
    Not because it was logical.
    But because somewhere along the way, this stupid little French hatchback stopped being transportation.

    It became a teacher.
    
    So here's to you, little shitbox.
    You taught me patience.
    You taught me persistence.
    You taught me that joy doesn't come from perfection but from involvement.

    I love you.
    And I hate you.
    And I wouldn't have it any other way.`
